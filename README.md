1.) This File can be used by jetson nano beginers to get a reference for file arrangements. and the way docker can save the files.
2.) This is a Temp repo for me as as cloud for later uses, i made this private so that people a=can make use of in anyways.
3.) I've been doing this project in ubuntu, and get used to Bash, Anaconda Dev Env., Docker, etc... 
4.) This also contains, few of datasets of Apple, and few hardwares under classification directory. Make use of it.
